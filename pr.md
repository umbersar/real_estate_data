Privacy Governance in APS: Impactful Actions

(STAR Examples)

In the Australian Public Service (APS), strong privacy governance is essential, especially for roles

handling sensitive information like a Freedom of Information (FOI) Practice Manager in the Department

of   Home   Affairs.   Working   in   compliance   with   the   APS   Code   of   Conduct   means   adhering   to   legal

requirements and upholding confidentiality. The APS Code explicitly requires employees to comply with

all   applicable   Australian   laws  (such   as   the   Privacy   Act   1988   and   FOI   Act   1982)   and   to  maintain

appropriate   confidentiality   of   official   information

1

2

.   The   Department’s   privacy   policy

implements   these   obligations   by   following   the   Privacy   Act’s   13   Australian   Privacy   Principles   (APPs),

which regulate the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of personal information

3

. In practice,

some of the most impactful privacy governance actions include:

•

Strict compliance with privacy laws and policies: Ensuring all handling of personal data aligns

with the Privacy Act, APPs, and the Department’s privacy policy (no unauthorized use or

disclosure of personal information).

•

Safeguarding personal information: Securing records (digital and physical) so that only

authorized personnel can access them and using information only for its official purpose

4

.

This includes applying the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) guidelines, such as

classifying sensitive data and enforcing “need-to-know” access controls.

•

Balancing FOI transparency with privacy: Applying FOI Act provisions to protect individual

privacy (e.g. using the personal information exemption when appropriate) while still facilitating

access to information. In other words, release what you can, redact what you must to prevent

unreasonable disclosure of others’ personal details

5

.

•

Proper retention and disposal of data: Keeping personal information only as long as required

and then securely destroying or archiving it in line with records authorities and the Archives

Act

6

. This prevents accumulation of unnecessary personal data and reduces privacy risk.

Below are two STAR examples demonstrating how an EL1 FOI Practice Manager might embody these

actions, showing impactful privacy governance in line with APS values and the Department’s privacy

policy.

Example 1: Safeguarding Personal Information in an FOI Release

(STAR)

Situation:  In her role as an FOI Practice Manager, Jane (EL1) received a complex FOI request seeking

documents   related   to   a   program   audit.   Some   of   the   responsive   documents   contained  personal

information about third parties (e.g. names and contact details of individuals who were mentioned in

internal emails). Releasing everything as-is would risk exposing private details, potentially breaching

the   Privacy   Act   and   departmental   policy.   This   put   Jane   in   a   position   of   balancing   the   FOI   Act’s

transparency objective with the privacy rights of individuals.

Task: Jane’s task was to process the FOI request in accordance with the law and policy – meaning she

needed to  give the applicant maximum access to information  while  protecting any personal or

sensitive data  that should not be disclosed. She had to identify which parts of the documents were

1

exempt from release on privacy grounds, justify those redactions under the FOI Act, and ensure her

actions complied with the Department of Home Affairs Privacy Policy and the APS Code of Conduct.

(Under the Privacy Act’s APPs, personal data should only be disclosed in ways that are authorized by law

3

,   and   the   FOI   Act   provides   a   specific   exemption   for   unreasonable   disclosures   of   personal

information

5

.)

Action: Jane carefully reviewed each document line by line, flagging any content that revealed personal

identifiers (such as private addresses, phone numbers, or names of junior staff and members of the

public). She consulted Section 47F of the FOI Act, which is the personal privacy exemption, confirming

that disclosure of those details would be an “unreasonable disclosure of personal information” about

someone   other   than   the   applicant

5

.   In   accordance   with   that   provision,   and   guided   by   the

Department’s privacy policy, she decided to  redact  (black out) the names and contact details of third

parties   while  releasing   the   remaining   information.   Jane   ensured   that   any   personal   information

belonging to the FOI applicant  themselves was left intact, since individuals have the right to access

their   own   personal   information   (and   such   information   would   not   be   exempt)

7

.   To   maintain

transparency, she documented her reasoning in the decision letter, citing the FOI Act exemption for

personal privacy and explaining that those redactions were made to protect individuals’ privacy in line

with departmental policy. Before finalizing, Jane double-checked that all redactions were necessary and

consulted the Department’s Privacy Officer for a quick review of the sensitive excerpts, showing due

diligence   in   privacy   governance.   She   also   verified   that   the  redacted   documents   were   properly

marked (e.g. “Edited Copy – s47F redactions”) and that no metadata or hidden personal data remained

in the electronic files.

Result:  Jane   released   the   FOI   documents   to   the   applicant   on   time,   with   clear   markings   where

information had been redacted to protect third-party privacy. The applicant received all the substantive

information they sought, minus the personal identifiers of other people. There were no complaints or

internal   review   requests  about   the   handling   of   personal   information   –   in   fact,   by   preemptively

addressing privacy concerns, Jane prevented potential privacy breaches or complaints to the Office of

the Australian Information Commissioner. The outcome upheld both open government principles and

the   Privacy   Act   obligations,   exemplifying   how   to   lawfully   balance   transparency   with   privacy.   This

successful FOI release reinforced that Jane  acts with integrity and diligence, as expected of an APS

employee, and strictly follows the Department’s Privacy Policy. Her actions in this situation were directly

in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles and departmental privacy rules on disclosure

of personal data

3

, as well as the APS Code of Conduct requirement to comply with law and protect

confidential   information.   This   example   demonstrates   an   impactful   privacy   governance   action:   using

legal exemptions and privacy principles to  prevent unauthorized personal information disclosure

while delivering services.

Example 2: Protecting Candidate Data in Recruitment Processes

(STAR)

Situation: In addition to FOI duties, Jane also manages recruitment of legal support staff in her division.

Recently,   she   led   a   hiring   round   for   new   legal   officers.   This   process   involved   handling  sensitive

personal information from dozens of applicants – including resumes with personal details, academic

records, and background check results (some candidates provided copies of IDs and security clearance

confirmations). All this information was provided in confidence for recruitment purposes. The situation

posed   a   significant   privacy   governance   challenge:  how   to   collect,   use,   and   store   applicant   data

responsibly  so that the Department meets its privacy obligations and candidates’ information is kept

safe from improper access or disclosure.

2

Task: Jane’s task was to run a fair and efficient recruitment while ensuring the personal information

of applicants was protected at every stage. Practically, this meant she had to limit access to these

documents, secure both electronic and hard copy records, and ultimately dispose of or retain them

properly   after   the   process.   She   also   needed   to   make   sure  everyone   involved   in   the   hiring   panel

respected confidentiality. Her goal was to comply with all relevant policies – the Department’s Privacy

Policy, APS Code of Conduct, and Australian Privacy Principles – which require using personal data only

for the intended purpose and keeping it confidential

4

. She also had to adhere to government

record-keeping rules for any documents kept on file, such as applications from successful candidates.

Action:  Jane   implemented   several   concrete   privacy   safeguards   during   the   recruitment.   First,   she

collected only the information needed  for assessing candidates (for example, she did not ask for

unnecessary personal details). On receiving applications, she ensured they were stored on a  secure

internal system with access restricted to the HR team and the selection panel members on a need-to-

know basis

4

. Electronic files were saved in a folder with permissions set only for the panel, and

physical documents were kept in a locked cabinet in her office. She reminded the panel members of

their confidentiality obligations under the APS Code of Conduct (e.g. not to discuss candidate details

outside   the   panel).   During   shortlisting   and   interviews,   Jane   marked   printed   materials   as   “OFFICIAL:

Sensitive”   since   they   contained   personal   particulars,   aligning   with   the   Protective   Security   Policy

Framework guidance on classifying information.

After   the   recruitment   was   completed,   Jane   took   care   to  dispose   of   personal   data   securely.   For

candidates   who   were   not   hired,   she   followed   the   Department’s   records   management   policies:

shredding or pulping paper files of resumes and forms, and deleting digital files from the shared drive

after   the   required   retention   period.   (According   to   government   privacy   guidelines,   when   personal

information is no longer required, it should be destroyed in a secure manner to prevent any further

disclosure

6

.) For the successful candidate, she transferred the necessary personal documents into

the Department’s HR system and ensured any extra copies were destroyed. By doing this, Jane made

sure that personal information was not kept longer than needed and that it couldn’t be accessed by

anyone once the process was over. Throughout the recruitment, she also handled any queries from

applicants   about   privacy   by   referring   them   to   the   Department’s   Privacy   Policy   notice   (which   was

included in the job application pack), showing transparency about how their data would be used.

Result: The recruitment process concluded with no privacy incidents – there were no lost documents,

no unauthorized access, and no complaints from applicants about misuse of their information. All panel

members strictly followed the protocols Jane set, which meant applicant data remained confidential and

was used only for its intended purpose (the hiring decision)

4

. By promptly and securely disposing

of the personal data of unsuccessful candidates, she eliminated the risk of that data being mishandled

in the future, in line with best practices and the department’s privacy guidelines. Jane’s diligent privacy

governance had a positive impact on team culture as well: her staff gained a stronger awareness of

privacy requirements, seeing them modeled in action. This example highlighted Jane’s commitment to

accountability   and   respect  (APS   Values)   –   she   treated   candidates’   personal   information   with   the

utmost   care   and  ensured   compliance   with   all   relevant   policies.   Her   actions   mirrored   the

department’s   Privacy   Policy   commitments   to   secure   storage   and   proper   handling   of   personal

information, as well as the APS Code of Conduct’s standards for confidentiality and lawful conduct.

Overall, this experience proved Jane to be a trustworthy custodian of sensitive data, an attribute highly

valuable for an EL2 role.

Conclusion

In summary, the most impactful privacy governance actions for an APS employee in Jane’s position

are those that  embed privacy compliance into everyday work. By strictly adhering to privacy laws
and   the   Department   of   Home   Affairs’   Privacy   Policy,   securing   personal   data   against   unauthorized

access,   exercising   judgment   to  withhold   private   information   when   releasing   documents,   and

responsibly managing the information lifecycle (from collection to destruction), she not only upholds

the APS Code of Conduct but also fosters public trust. These examples illustrate how applying the APS

values of integrity, accountability, and respect in practical situations – through the STAR framework –

leads   to   outcomes   that   are   both  helpful   (protecting   individuals’   privacy)  and  useful   (ensuring

departmental compliance and reputation). Jane’s demonstrated actions in privacy governance show

she is prepared to take on the higher responsibilities of an EL2 role, continuing to champion privacy and

confidentiality as integral parts of public service excellence.
